# satori-images

Here you can find various OS image files created by satori-imager (Satori suite can be found here: https://github.com/operatorequals/satori).

All OSes that got imaged were installed in VirtualBox, had a non-root user (uid:1000) called "user" with password "user", had a Locale of "New York" and were fully updated && upgraded at date of publication. They generally have all default settings, and the image was taken after installation and upgrade.
The only non-default setting in most OSes is the git installation, required to download the Satori suite.
